Project Summary -
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) serves as a crucial initial step in understanding the characteristics and patterns within a dataset. In this project, we conducted an in-depth EDA of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to extract meaningful insights into the patterns, trends, and underlying factors of global terrorism over the years.

The Global Terrorism Database or GTD began in 2001 when researchers at the University of Maryland obtained a large database originally collected by the Pinkerton Global Intelligence Services (PGIS). From 1970 to 1997, PGIS recorded terrorism incidents from wire services, government reports, and major international newspapers. With funding from the National Institute of Justice, the Maryland team finished digitizing the original Pinkerton data in December 2005. In April 2006, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), working with the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies (CETIS), received additional funding from the Human Factors Division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to extend the GTD beyond 1997. CETIS collected GTD data for terrorist attacks that occurred from January 1998 through March 2008, after which ongoing data collection transitioned to the Institute for the Study of Violent Groups (ISVG). ISVG continued as the primary collector of data on attacks that occurred from April 2008 through October 2011. Beginning with cases that occurred in November 2011, all ongoing GTD data collection is conducted by START staff at the University of Maryland.

The project involves cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, and ensuring consistency in data types. Cleaning was essential to maintain data integrity throughout the analysis. We plotted the number of incidents each year to observe trends and identify periods with significant changes in terrorism frequency and investigated if there were any seasonal patterns in terrorist activities by analyzing monthly data. Utilizing geospatial visualizations, we explored the geographical distribution of terrorism incidents to identify high-risk regions and tried to identify regions with higher concentrations of terrorist activities using cluster analysis. We've also examined the distribution of attack types to identify predominant methods used by terrorists and investigated the types of weapons commonly employed in terrorist incidents. We've identified major terrorist groups based on the dataset and analyzed the frequency and severity of incidents involving specific terrorist organizations. This project also sheds light on the impact of terrorism in terms of human casualties, including fatalities and injuries and how the number of casualties has changed over the years.

In essence, the Global Terrorism Analysis project has been a comprehensive endeavor aimed at fostering a safer global environment. By dissecting and comprehending the factors contributing to terrorism, the project has armed policymakers and security agencies with data-driven insights to design proactive strategies. From the identification of high-risk regions to the understanding of organizational structures, the project's conclusions provide a roadmap for proactive prevention rather than reactive response.

Note:- PGIS lost data for 1993 in an office move and these data have never been fully recovered. Only 15% of the data was recovered. As a consequence, START excluded all 1993 attacks from the GTD data to prevent users from misinterpreting the low frequency in 1993 as an actual count.

# Problem Statement
BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW

The GTD, maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), provides a comprehensive record of terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 to the present. The dataset includes information on various aspects, such as the location, date, attack type, weapons used, and the groups involved.

The EDA on Global Terrorism Dataset focusses on analyzing how the frequency of terrorist incidents has evolved over time. It explores the distribution of terrorism across countries and regions and investigates the prevalent methods and weapons used in terrorist attacks. It focuses on identifying major terrorist groups and their activities, and examining the impact of terrorism in terms of human casualties.

In a rapidly changing geopolitical landscape, it is essential to anticipate and address emerging threats. The project's goal is to offer actionable intelligence to facilitate easier decision-making by the policymakers and security agencies. By meeting the project's objectives, this analysis will aid in formulating effective strategies to prevent and counteract terrorism. By harnessing data-driven insights, the project endeavors to enhance international collaboration, judiciously allocate the resources, and foster a safer world for individuals, communities, and nations.
